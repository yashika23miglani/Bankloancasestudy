# Bank loan case study

This case study focuses on conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations and statistical summaries on loan application data. The goal is to identify factors influencing an applicant's likelihood of defaulting versus being a non-defaulter. Through this analysis, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters, facilitating a better understanding of credit risk factors.

Approach
The EDA comprises the following steps:

1. Data Exploration
Data exploration involves understanding the structure and characteristics of the loan application dataset.
Initial exploration includes examining data types, summary statistics, and identifying missing values.
2. Visualization
Visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots will be used to visualize the distribution and relationships between variables.
Visualizations aid in identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
3. Statistical Summaries
Statistical summaries, including measures of central tendency, variability, and correlation coefficients, will be calculated to gain deeper insights into the data.
Statistical summaries help quantify relationships between variables and assess their significance.
4. Identification of Credit Risk Factors
Through analysis of the loan application data, we aim to identify factors that influence an applicant's likelihood of defaulting.
By comparing characteristics of defaulters and non-defaulters, we can uncover key credit risk factors.
Key Objectives
Identify factors influencing an applicant's likelihood of defaulting.
Differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters based on loan application data.
Gain insights into credit risk factors to inform lending decisions and risk management strategies
